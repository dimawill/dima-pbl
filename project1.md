Project Steps
Spun up an Ubuntu server on the AWS console
Installed Apache and updated the firewall
Configured ports to allow traffic to the instance (port 80)
Ran the curl command to allow APACHE HTTP server on port 80
Installed mysql and connected to it
Installed PHP
Created a virtual host for the website using Apache
Set up a domain and created a directory for Project Lamp
Configured the virtual host and instruct APACHE to serve Project Lamp using /var/www/projectlampl
Disabled default website that came with APACHE to prevent overwriting virtual host
Created an index.html file in /var/www/projectlampl to test virtual host works as expected
Enabled PHP on the website
